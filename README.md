# COLOR_DETECTION PROJECT
In this color detection project using Python, the first step is to import the required libraries such as NumPy, OpenCV, and Matplotlib. The image is then loaded using OpenCV's imread() function, and the image is converted to a NumPy array for easier manipulation. Various color spaces can be used for color detection, such as RGB, HSV, and LAB. Once the image is converted to the desired color space, a color thresholding technique can be applied to extract the desired colors from the image. The extracted colors can be displayed using Matplotlib's imshow() function. For real-time color detection, the same process can be applied to video frames captured using a webcam or mobile camera. The project can be further extended to identify and track specific objects based on their color using object detection techniques. Color detection projects using Python can have various applications such as in robotics, autonomous vehicles, and image processing.
